# Kaggle Competition
## I'm Something of an Painter Myself
Welcome, this is my project for the Kaggle competition [I'm Something of a Painter Myself](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started). For this project I'm building on the [tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/code/amyjang/monet-cyclegan-tutorial/notebook) offered by Amy Jang.

## The Problem / Objective
This competition is based on the premise of replicating Claude Monet's art style by inputing an image of a landscape. I'll be try to use GANs accordingly to use both a Generator and a Discriminator Networks that face against each other in order to obtain a great result.

## Requirments
This project uses the tesnroflow and keras libraries to create the networks that are going to be used. Additionally this project was ran through the Kaggle kernes and enabled the TPU as per the recommendation of the initial tutorial to obtain a faster response.

Thank you very much for stopping by, feel free to leave any feedback on Kaggle.
